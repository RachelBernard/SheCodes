     <h2>What is Veganism?</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Veganism</strong> is the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products,
      particularly in diet, and an associated philosophy that rejects the
      commodity status of animals. An individual who follows the diet or
      philosophy is known as a vegan. Distinctions may be made between several
      categories of veganism. <span class = type>Dietary vegans,</span> also known as <em>strict
      vegetarians</em> refrain from consuming meat, eggs, dairy products, and any
      other animal-derived substances. An <span class = type>ethical vegan</span>, also known as a <em>moral
      vegetarian</em>, is someone who not only follows a vegan diet but extends the
      philosophy into other areas of their lives, and opposes the use of animals
      for any purpose. Another term is <em>environmental veganism</em>, which refers to
      the avoidance of animal products on the premise that the industrial
      farming of animals is environmentally damaging and unsustainable.
